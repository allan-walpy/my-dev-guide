## rule of three

> see also [abstraction: the rule of three](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/10/31/abstraction-the-rule-of-three/);

*if you need something* **twice**, **pay attention** to it;

## principles of object oriented programming

> see also [object-oriented programming fundamental principles](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/Object-Oriented-Programming/tree/master/Topics/04.%20OOP-Principles-Part-1);

**encapsulation**: bundling data with the methods operating on that data;

**abstraction**: keep common features/attributes in various concrete objects;

**inheritance**: basing class upon another, retaining similar implementation;

**polymorphism**: providing a single interface to different types entities;
